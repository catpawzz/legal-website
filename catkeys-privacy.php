            <p>Thank you for using CatKeys! Your privacy is very important to us, and we are committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains how "CatKeys" collects, uses, and discloses information when you use our app.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2><br>
            <p>CatKeys does not collect any personal data or user information. All communication is done directly between your device and the Misskey instance you choose to connect to. We do not operate any servers to store or process user data. Your data stays between you and the Misskey instance you interact with.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>2. No Data Sent to Our Servers</h2><br>
            <p>CatKeys is a standalone application and does not require any servers of ours to function. We do not track or log any information about your usage of the app. All interactions, including logins, posts, and any other actions, are performed solely between you and the Misskey instance you connect to.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2><br>
            <p>Since CatKeys is a third-party client for Misskey, you should review the privacy policy of the Misskey instance you are connecting to, as CatKeys is not responsible for any data handling or practices performed by that instance. Each instance may have its own policies regarding data collection, storage, and usage.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>4. Security</h2><br>
            <p>We take security seriously. Although CatKeys does not store or manage any user data, we recommend that you use strong passwords and enable any available security features on the Misskey instance you connect to. We encourage users to practice safe browsing habits.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2><br>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any significant changes, we will notify users via the app or other means. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>6. Contact Us</h2><br>
            <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:cat@french-femboi.eu">cat@french-femboi.eu</a>. We will be happy to assist you! üò∫</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Thank you for trusting CatKeys. We hope you enjoy using the app! üò∏‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
